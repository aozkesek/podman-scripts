Making a Devops container farm with Podman

	All container images are built from the Alpine:3 image. Use Alpine 
Package Manager, "apk add", to install new packages.
	
	Run podman-init.sh script at first.  It creates network and storage 
used by the containers.
	
	Each build folder containes a Containerfile file and some compressed
external file(s) that needed by the container image. Enter each folder and run 
"podman build . -t <tag>".  You should download and copy that external file(s) 
as TAR.XZ compressed before build the container.  Or update the Containerfile 
file and change compress method/type as best for you.

Containers

	devop-build: 
		The base container image that containes development tools like 
		git, gcc, make, jdk-11, gradle.  You can add others upon you 
		need with "apk add <packagename>" alpine package manager.
		
		The other CI/CD containers, or their agents/workers, like 
		buildbot, gocd or jenkins should be built on top of this image.
	 
	gitea-build: SCM
		A Git SCM server than can be used as change source by the CI/CD.
		
		
	buildbot-build: CI/CD
