Making a Devops container farm with Podman

	Please go https://podman.io/ for more help.
	
	All container images are built from the Alpine:3 image. Use Alpine 
Package Manager, "apk add", to customize the container image.
	
	Each build folder containes a Dockerfile file and some compressed
external file(s) that needed by the container image. To build a container image
run "podman build <path-to-dockerfile> -t <tag>". 

Containers

	alpine3-build:
		This image is the base for every other image.  It uses Alpine:3
		and add some core packages in it such as bash, xz, git, and
		coreutils.
		
	devops-build: 
		It extends alpine3 image and adds some development packages or 
		build tools like gcc, make, jdk-11, gradle.  Used by any CI/CD 
		tool images. Other package(s) can be added by 
		"apk add <packagename>" alpine package manager.
	 
	gitea-build: SCM
		A simple, easy to use and configure Git SCM server.  It's free
		and opensource. You can download it from https://gitea.io

	CI/CD Tools;
		jenkins, buildbot or gocd are free and opensource.  I picked 
	jenkins here.
